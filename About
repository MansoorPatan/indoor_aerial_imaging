Aerial imaging is mainly done with small planes from several kilometers of altitude which involves high cost and manual support. An unmanned micro aerial vehicle with a camera mounted on it is an alternative airborne platform. This type of system allows fast aerial imaging of small areas with a higher level of detail and lower cost. A typical MAV with a bottom and frontal camera which can be communicated with the computer over WIFI opens up an opportunity to sense the environment and take decisions with the help of computer vision algorithms. It can be used for updates of geographical maps after natural phenomena, e.g. update of routes in the areas affected by floods. The two cameras help to reconstruct an unknown 3D environment of which the drone navigates. In this project, we used AR drone as a MAV and ROS as a platform to program it. We have developed a new package named ‘rkv_ardrone’ to traverse a specific area and capture images. The images are then stitched together to give a composite and high detailed view of the region.
